# Spatial, temporal, & scale mismatches
Sometimes, the need for an ecosystem service and the ability of the environment to provide that service don't match up. Here we discuss mismatches 
occurring across space, time and scale.

## Introduction

Sometimes, the need for an ecosystem service (demand) and the ability of the environment to provide that service (supply) don't match up. 
No-overlap between supply and demand can occur either in different places (spatial mismatch), at different times (temporal mismatch) or at 
different scales (scale mismatch).

For example, some insects, small mammals, and birds contribute to fertilization of plants (that is, to pollination) while they are feeding 
and moving among flowers. Pollinators have to move from their nesting places to their feeding sites. Where pollinators originate from in the 
landscape is the area of pollination supply. On the other side, demand for pollination occurs where there are plants that need pollination. 
When there is a large separation between where pollinators originate from (supply) and where they feed and pollinate (demand), supply and 
demand do not match in space.


### Case study
We'll explore some examples of when demand and supply don't line up using the ecosystem service of pollination as an example. This mismatch 
can happen in three main ways:

1) Spatial mismatch: If we look at different landscapes, even when there's the same amount of space for pollinators, some farmlands may have 
more pollinators simply because their crops are closer to nesting sites. The location and the configuration of nesting sites can influence the 
availability of pollinators inside fields. For example, studies in crop fields show that the abundance of pollinators tends to be higher in 
smaller crop fields (e.g. 2 ha) than in large ones (e.g. 100 ha). If crop fields' edges have suitable places for pollinators to nest, then 
pollinators will find it easier to fly to the center of the field and pollinate smaller fields compared to larger fields. The plants in the 
center of a large field might be out of reach for some pollinators, given their limited flying range.

2) Temporal mismatch: Not all pollinators are active at the same time nor during all seasons of crop blooming. Crops may bloom at times that 
do not always coincide with all insectsâ€™s periods of high activity. As the climate changes, the periods of time when crops bloom and the periods 
of time when bees have high activity may no longer align, which may result in greater temporal mismatches.

3) Scale mismatch: The entire process of pollination needs a specific size and arrangement of the land. One farmer might not have enough land to 
establish a nice hedgerow or a flower strip to support the pollinators, or arrange it in the best way for them. But if many farmers work together, 
they might be able to create the right conditions for pollinators. This means that encouraging cooperation between farmers might be more successful 
than asking one farmer to increase bee-friendly habitats. This is because the size of a single farm might be too small to match the large-scale needs 
of the pollination process, and this is an example of scale mismatch.

## Best Practices and Opportunities

* Understand the service area: Think about the whole area that benefits from the ecosystem service, like pollination, and identify who or what benefits from it.
Compare across beneficiaries: Look at different groups or areas that benefit from the service and compare them. This can help identify different needs and how 
they might be met.
* Identify the benefit gap: Try to figure out where the mismatches between supply and demand are. Where are the needs not being met? Understanding this gap can 
help in planning how to fix it.
* Think about the arrangement and size of habitat areas: It's not just about how much habitat there is for the pollinators, but also about how this 
habitat is arranged. The layout and size of the land can influence how well it supports the pollinators and provides the needed service.

By considering these points, we can better understand how to manage and support many ecosystem services like pollination. It helps in creating a plan that fits 
the specific needs of the area and the people who depend on these services.
